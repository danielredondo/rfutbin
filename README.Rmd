futbin_search(name = c("Lionel Messi", "Cristiano Ronaldo"))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
Sys.sleep(3)
```

#### Search for a specific version of a player

```{r}

## Functions

### futbin_search 

`futbin_search` searchs players in Futbin. It has the following parameters:

- `name`. Optional. Vector with the names of the players. If not specified, it will report the 30 highest-rated players of the game.

- `platform`. Platform to get the prices from. Default is `ps4`. Other options are `xone` (XBox One) and `pc`.

- `version`. Optional. Version of the cards. Some options are "Rare", "Non-Rare", "IF" (In-Form), "SIF" (Second In-Form), ...

- `verbose`. Optional. To show additional messages (webpage scraped and number of players found).

The output of the function is a dataframe with all the players found searching for `name` and  `version`.

### futbin_scrap 

`futbin_scrap` extracts all players of a Futbin URL. It has the following parameters:

- `url`. Futbin URL to web scrap. Futbin webpage (https://www.futbin.com/players) can be used to make customised filters, and then copy the URL here. All the players found in the URL (and the next pages) will be automatically detected and downloaded.

- `platform`. Platform to get the prices from. Default is `ps4`. Other options are `xone` (XBox One) and `pc`.

- `sleep_time`. Time (in seconds) ellapsed between scraping one page and the next one. Please respect Futbin API.

- `verbose`. Optional. To show additional verbose about webpage used and number of players found.

The output of the function is a dataframe with all the players found at the URL.

### futbin_plot 

`futbin_plot` makes an interactive radar plot of the stats of the players. It has the following parameters:

- `df` dataframe generated with columns `pac`, `sho`, `pas`, `dri`, `def`, `phy`. This dataframe can be obtained from function `futbin_search`.

- `gk` Optional. If `TRUE`, the labels of the plot are the main stats for goalkeepers: diving, handling, kicking, reflexes, speed and position.

The output of the function is an interactive radar plot of the stats.
