## Usage

### futbin_search

The output of the function is a dataframe with all the players found searching for `name` and  `version`.


### futbin_plot 

`futbin_plot` makes an interactive radar plot of the stats of the players. It has the following parameters:

- `df` dataframe generated with columns `pac`, `sho`, `pas`, `dri`, `def`, `phy`. This dataframe can be obtained from function `futbin_search`.
- `gk` Optional. If `TRUE`, the labels of the plot are the stats for goalkeepers: diving, handling, kicking, reflexes, speed and position.
